A python program that scans your network for open ports.

It uses the `socket` library to scan for open ports on a given IP address.

How it works:
- The program takes an IP address as input.
- It then scans the the start and end port the user chooses on that IP address.
- It then prints out the open ports on that IP address.

This program is useful for network administrators who want to scan their network for open ports.

To run the program, simply run the `port_scanner.py`.
